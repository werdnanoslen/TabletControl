Tablet PCs are great with their versatility; however, their hardware switches for things like security, flipping the screen, and other fun tablet PC things are usually only available for major platforms. Considering I'm running Arch, there is no good, and definitely no safe or easy, way to get these working. Instead, I'm taking a software approach to controlling these things from the screen via touch input.
